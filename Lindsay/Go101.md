# Go lang 101

## Background of Go lang
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson had a problem. Server software was needless complicated to create. Another issue was computers were becoming quicker but programming languages were not. To solve their problems they set out to create a new programming language. Their main goal was to create a program that was easy to use and would be as fast as the computer it ran on.
Go lang was based on the best features of C, Pascal, and Oberon programming languages.
